# If a request of the driver for a specific record fails for any reason,
# this is the maximum number of times that record should be automatically
# retried before giving up on that record.  If this is exceeded, the
# record information will remain in the rcFailure table until it is dealt
# with manually.
#
proai.maxFailedRetries = 3

# The maximum size the in-memory record commit queue is allowed to reach.
# If this threshold is reached, it means that worker threads are returning
# results faster than they can be committed to the database by the commit
# thread.  If this occurs, workers will have to wait until more items have
# been committed before they can add any more to the queue.
#
proai.maxCommitQueueSize = 120

# The maximum number of record updates (from the in-memory commit queue)

# Where OAI-PMH session data will be stored when needed.

# Proai.  If this value is set to true, memory requirements for Proai
# will be lower, but query performance will suffer.  For more detail,

# The Fedora dissemination type for each format.

# <p>A Fedora dissemination type is a URI starting with

# a Behavior Definition PID followed by "/methodName",
# or a Behavior Definition PID followed by "/methodName?name=value".</p>
#
# <p>The dissType is the key to mapping an OAI metadata format to
# a kind of Fedora dissemination.  Here are a few examples:</p>
#
# <pre>
# info:fedora/*/DC                  ; identifies the "DC" datastream
#
# info:fedora/*/demo:1/getDC        ; identifies the "getDC" method of the
#                                   ; demo:1 behavior definition
#
# info:fedora/*/demo:1/getMD?fmt=dc ; identifies the "getMD" method of the
#                                   ; demo:1 behavior definition, when

# </pre>
#
# When the OAI provider queries Fedora for records in your_format,
# it uses this special value to constrain the query to only those
# disseminations that are in the expected format.
# Thus, all records that the OAI provider considers to be in
# your_format must have this dissemination type.

# The Fedora dissemination type for each format.
#
# This optional property identifies the OAI "about" dissemination
# type for your_format. If specified for your_format, then the OAI provider
# will attempt to find disseminations of this type for each object
# that has a matching your_format.dissType.  If such a dissemination
# is found, for that particular object, the information therein
# will be used as the "about" metadata for the record.
#
# Example property name:
